**Last Updated:** November 5, 2025

**About MOAI™?**

MOAI™ is an intelligent, human-centered AI Coach built by Enablerz to democratize access to coaching for every individual in an organization.

Rooted in empathy and guided by internationally recognised coaching standards, MOAI™ is an AI-driven coaching assistant built on Enablerz’ evidence-based THRIVE HOLISTIC COACHING FRAMEWORK™. Unlike chatbots or diagnostic tools, MOAI™ functions as a true thinking partner—designed to ask powerful, reflective questions that help employees explore their situations with depth, clarity, and self-awareness. It supports individuals across themes such as work–life balance, leadership, professional development, behaviour at work, relationships, and overall well-being, without offering prescriptive answers or replacing professional coaching, therapy, or crisis support.

Powered by Enablerz’ digital coaching ecosystem, MOAI™ draws from the organisation’s strengths: personalised 1:1 coaching methodologies, the proprietary THRIVE HOLISTIC COACHING FRAMEWORK™ model, a global network of rigorously selected certified coaches, and deep experience in driving behavioural and performance outcomes across diverse industries. This is in line with ICF Artificial Intelligence Coaching Standards. Enablerz’ platform has been used by organisations to boost employee engagement, elevate performance, enhance well-being, create tailored learning paths, and generate meaningful data-driven insights for organisational growth. MOAI™ brings the essence of these capabilities to every employee—scaling coaching access, enabling continuous self-improvement, and making reflective practice a part of everyday work life.

MOAI™ is not a chatbot, not a diagnostic tool, and not a performance evaluator. It is a thinking partner —designed to ask powerful questions, encourage reflection, and empower employees to take meaningful action.

## 1. What Makes It Unique

MOAI™ is an AI-driven coaching companion designed to help employees reflect deeply on
personal and professional situations such as work–life balance, interpersonal dynamics, leadership
skills, career development, behavioural patterns, and workplace ethos. Built on recognised
coaching principles (including those aligned with the International Coaching Federation),
MOAI™ focuses on asking powerful, reflective, and insight-oriented questions that enable users
to think more clearly, develop self-awareness, and explore their own solutions. Unlike prescriptive
tools, MOAI™ is intentionally designed not to give ready-made answers but to guide users toward
thoughtful internal clarity.

MOAI™ is not a therapist, counsellor, medical practitioner, financial advisor, or any form of
professional advisor. The platform is designed purely for reflective prompts, self-exploration, and
general guidance. Nothing generated by MOAI™ should be treated as clinical, therapeutic,
medical, legal, or financial advice. All choices, actions, and decisions you make remain entirely
your own and are not directed, influenced, or determined by the AI companion. MOAI™’s role is
limited to offering insights for your personal reflection, and you retain full responsibility for
evaluating and acting on any information provided by the system. It does not diagnose, treat, or
provide clinical, psychological, legal, medical, or financial advice. It is not a substitute for
specialist or emergency services. If you are experiencing distress, a mental-health crisis, suicidal
thoughts, or any form of emergency, please seek immediate assistance from qualified professionals
or local emergency services. Any conversations involving sexual harassment, suicidal ideation,
self-harm, threats, or other harmful or high-risk content may be automatically flagged at the
organisational level for safety, compliance, and necessary intervention.

What makes MOAI™ unique is its blend of structured coaching methodology, AI-powered
conversational intelligence, and a privacy-respecting architecture that prioritises user trust. It
adapts to your communication style, supports your self-reflection journey, and helps you articulate
thoughts, values, and goals more clearly—while maintaining boundaries appropriate to coaching
and non-clinical guidance. MOAI™’s aim is to facilitate personal insight, encourage mindful
decision-making, and empower individuals to navigate challenges with greater clarity and
confidence, without overstepping into areas requiring human expertise, therapy, or authoritative
guidance.

## 2. Coaching Approach and Limitations
MOAI™’s coaching model is intentionally question-based, reflective, and exploratory, rather than
prescriptive. It guides you by prompting deeper thinking, reframing perspectives, and surfacing
insights that you may not have considered, but it does not provide direct instructions, authoritative
advice, or guaranteed solutions. The goal is to support self-awareness, personal development, and
decision-making autonomy, not to substitute your own judgment or the expertise of trained
professionals.

The responses you receive are generated based on the information you share, patterns in language,
and coaching-aligned frameworks. Because of this, outcomes may vary across individuals,
contexts, and situations. MOAI™ cannot fully account for personal history, emotional nuance, or
real-world complexities, and therefore its suggestions should be viewed as supportive prompts,
not definitive answers.

You should not rely on MOAI™ as the sole basis for any significant decisions—whether related
to mental health, medical issues, legal situations, financial planning, or major life events. MOAI™
is not a licensed therapist, counsellor, doctor, or financial advisor. If your situation requires expert
evaluation, crisis support, or personalised human judgment, you should seek assistance from an
appropriately qualified professional.

MOAI™ is a complementary tool: it enhances personal reflection and learning, but it does not
replace structured professional coaching, therapy, or specialized advisory services when such

support is needed. We are not liable or accountable for any incorrect, incomplete, or misleading
advice generated by the system, and you agree that all decisions based on such outputs are made
at your own discretion and risk.

## 3. Anonymization, Aggregation & Sentiment Reporting
MOAI™ generates aggregate sentiment analysis reports and summary insights that are created
from anonymized chats and interactions across multiple participants. These analytics are strictly
aggregate in nature—for example, high-level trends, sentiment distributions, usage patterns,
category-level summaries, and cohort-level behavioural insights. The purpose of these reports is
to help organisations understand overall themes, engagement levels, and development needs across
the workforce, without ever identifying any individual user.

All personal identifiers—such as names, email IDs, timestamps that can link back to a person,
unique chat IDs, or any directly identifying metadata—are removed before aggregation. MOAI™
uses privacy-preserving techniques to ensure that no output can be reverse-engineered to reveal a
specific participant’s conversations, behaviours, or emotional patterns. Individual chat transcripts,
personal coaching reflections, or sensitive discussions are never included in any report shared with
organisations or administrators.

Aggregate insights are processed solely to enhance MOAI™’s product experience, strengthen
coaching program design, identify workplace themes at a macro level, and support organisational
well-being initiatives. These insights also help improve MOAI™’s reflective questioning models
in a responsible, compliant, and privacy-focused manner.

Additionally, MOAI™ implements strict access controls, audit logs, and organisational safeguards
to ensure that only authorised personnel can access anonymized analytics. No employee, manager,
or admin receives access to a user’s private chat history or personal reflections at any point.

---

## 4. Human Access and Review
MOAI™ is designed to minimise human access to raw, identifiable chat content. By default, chats
are processed through automated systems, and human involvement occurs only in limited,

exceptional circumstances. If human review becomes necessary—for example, to investigate
potential misuse of the platform, address safety concerns, respond to technical issues, or comply
with legal requirements—access is granted under strict, multi-layered controls.

All human access is role-based and restricted solely to authorised personnel who are trained in
confidentiality, ethics, and data-protection obligations. Access is logged, monitored, and subject
to audit trails to ensure accountability and prevent misuse. Wherever possible, reviews are
conducted using de-identified, pseudonymised, or minimised data so that reviewers see only the
information required to resolve the specific issue.

Any human review activities are governed by internal data-handling policies, least-privilege
principles, compliance standards under DPDPA and GDPR, and contractual confidentiality
obligations. Unauthorised access, extraction, or disclosure of user information is strictly prohibited
and subject to disciplinary and legal consequences. The objective of this framework is to ensure
that users’ conversations remain private, secure, and shielded from unnecessary human visibility
at all times.

---

## 5. Voice Input & Speech Data
If you use voice features, your spoken input will be processed to convert speech to text for the
coaching interaction and for aggregate analytics. Voice data will be handled in accordance with
the privacy and security commitments in our Privacy Policy; by using voice features you explicitly
consent to such processing. If you do not wish to provide voice data, please use text chat only.

---

## 6. Use Of Data To Improve The Model

MOAI™ may use anonymized, de-identified, and aggregated interaction data to improve the
performance, accuracy, and reliability of the coaching model. This includes refining the quality of
questions generated by MOAI™, strengthening conversational understanding, enhancing
category-specific responses, and developing new or improved features within the platform. All
data used for these purposes undergoes strict minimization and anonymization processes, ensuring

that raw personal identifiers are removed before the data is used in any training or analytics
activity.

Any model improvement initiative—whether internal to MOAI™, executed through approved
service providers, or involving third-party AI infrastructure—follows industry-standard privacy
and security principles, including data minimization, purpose limitation, privacy-by-design, and
privacy-by-default. These practices ensure that the likelihood of re-identification is extremely low.
MOAI™ does not use identifiable user chats or account information for training without a lawful
basis and, where required by law (such as under GDPR or DPDPA), explicit user consent.

All model-improvement workflows are subject to internal governance controls, including
documentation of training datasets, review of anonymization techniques, access restrictions, and
periodic audits. These measures ensure that model development aligns with MOAI™’s
commitment to transparency, ethical AI standards, and user trust. The platform does not use
coaching transcripts in a way that exposes individual conversations to other users, organizations,
or unauthorized personnel for any purpose.

## 7. Privacy, Compliance & Legal Framework
Enablerz is committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy, security, and ethical data
use. MOAI™ is designed and operated in accordance with the Digital Personal Data Protection
Act, 2023 (DPDPA – India) and, where applicable, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR

EU/EEA), along with other regional frameworks that may apply as the platform expands (such
as Singapore PDPA).
All personal data collected or processed within MOAI™ is handled under clearly defined roles—
Data Fiduciary/Data Processor under DPDPA and Controller/Processor under GDPR. Enablerz
ensures that every party participating in MOAI™’s operations, including technology partners and
service providers, follows strict technical, administrative, and organisational safeguards. These
safeguards include encryption, access controls, audit trails, role-based permissions, and privacy-
by-design practices embedded throughout the product lifecycle.

MOAI™ follows the principles of lawful, transparent, purpose-limited, and minimal data
processing. Data is collected only when genuinely necessary for providing and improving the
service, and never for unrelated or unauthorized purposes. We uphold user rights such as access,
correction, deletion, portability, withdrawal of consent, and grievance redressal, subject to the
conditions of applicable laws.

Cross-border data transfers (if any) are executed only under valid legal mechanisms, such as
Standard Contractual Clauses under GDPR or DPDPA-compliant safeguards, ensuring that
equivalent protection travels along with the data.

For complete details on how data is collected, used, stored, shared, and retained—including
compliance frameworks, legal bases of processing, and user rights—you may refer to the full
MOAI™ Privacy Policy or contact our dedicated privacy team at [privacy@enablerz.co
] / [link placeholder].

---

## 8. Data Retention & Deletion Rights
Anonymized aggregate outputs may be retained indefinitely for statistical and product-
improvement purposes. Identifiable or semi-identifiable information — if captured — will be
retained only for a limited period as specified in the Privacy Policy (for example, up to 24 months)
unless you exercise your legal rights for deletion or limited processing, subject to applicable law
and any overriding legal obligations. You may request access, correction, or deletion of your
personal data by contacting the Data Protection Officer at privacy@enablerz.co or using the in-
app data controls (where available).

---

## 9. Confidentiality & Sensitive Topics
MOAI™ is designed with strong privacy, security, and anonymization measures; however, it is
not intended for the submission of highly sensitive or regulated personal data. You should avoid
sharing information such as medical records, financial account details, government-issued ID
numbers, precise geolocation, passwords, biometric identifiers, or other categories considered
“sensitive personal data” under GDPR, DPDPA, or similar laws.

While MOAI™ aims to maintain confidentiality and ensure safe interactions, the safest practice is
to keep discussions general, non-identifying, and reflective rather than revealing deeply personal
or confidential details.

MOAI™ is not a substitute for professional services. If you require medical, psychological, legal,
financial, or other professional advice, you must consult a qualified specialist. In cases of mental-
health concerns or emergencies, please contact a licensed mental-health practitioner or relevant
local authorities.

---

## 10. Aggregation Cohorts & Non-Personal Statistics
Reports and dashboards derived from MOAI™ may present cohort-level breakdowns (for
example, by function, site, age group, or gender split) to help organisations design better people
programs. These breakdowns are generated using non-identifiable, aggregated data and are
presented only in ways that avoid singling out individuals.

---

## 11. Intellectual Property & Content Ownership
Interactions with MOAI™ (user prompts and AI responses) may be logged to provide continuity
of conversation. Unless otherwise agreed, Enablerz retains rights to aggregated and anonymized
outputs used for product improvement, while users retain ownership of their own submissions to
the extent allowed by law. Any third-party data used to train models is used under appropriate
licences and legal bases.

---

## 12. Safety, Misuse & Prohibited Behaviour
Users must not use MOAI™ to solicit, promote, or disseminate unlawful content, harassment,
discrimination, or abusive behaviour. Enablerz reserves the right to suspend or block access for
users who misuse the platform, attempt to reverse-engineer the model, or otherwise violate terms
of use. If MOAI™ identifies potential self-harm, illegal activity, or harm to others, the platform
may take safety actions including escalation to appropriate authorities as required by law.

---

## 13. Disclaimer Of Warranties & Limitation of Liability

MOAI™ is provided “as is” to facilitate coaching and reflection. Enablerz makes reasonable
efforts to ensure system availability and data security, but disclaims any guarantees regarding
outcomes, accuracy of analysis, or suitability for particular purposes. To the maximum extent
permitted by law, Enablerz and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
consequential, or punitive damages arising from use of MOAI™. This clause does not limit
liability for fraud, gross negligence, or obligations that cannot be excluded by law.

---

and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in these documents, including processing

Your continued use of MOAI™ constitutes your explicit acceptance of all terms, notices, and
policies referenced herein. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must discontinue
