This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, store, and protect your information
when you access or use our website, platform, or services (“ **Services** ”). This policy covers all
jurisdictions in which we operate and aligns with major global privacy regulations, including, the
Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (India), the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) and other regional applicable laws.

please contact us at privacy@enablerz.co or write to our Data Protection Officer on the same.


## 2. Definitions

**2.1 “Personal Information” / “Personal Data”**

“Personal Information” (under India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023) and “Personal
Data” (under GDPR) refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable
individual. This includes obvious identifiers such as names, email addresses, phone numbers,
account information, and government IDs, but also extends to indirect identifiers such as device
IDs, location data, IP addresses, behavioral signals, or any data that can reasonably be linked to a
person when combined with other information. Under both GDPR and DPDPA, the scope covers
any data that enables identification either directly or indirectly.

**2.2 “Processing”**

“Processing” includes any action performed on Personal Information, whether automated or
manual. This spans the full lifecycle of data: collection (such as when you submit information or
interact with MOAI™), storage (including cloud-based systems), organization, analysis,
adaptation or modification, retrieval, sharing or disclosure, anonymization, archiving, and
deletion. Under GDPR, processing is interpreted extremely widely, and under the DPDPA, it
includes any operation performed on digital personal data. The scope includes both.

**2.3 “Controller,” “Processor,” “Data Fiduciary,” and “Data Processor”**

Under **GDPR** , a _Controller_ is the entity that determines the purpose and means of processing
Personal Data, while a _Processor_ handles Personal Data on behalf of the Controller and only under
documented instructions. Under **India’s DPDPA** , a _Data Fiduciary_ performs a role equivalent to
a Controller and decides why and how personal data is processed; a _Data Processor_ processes data
purely on the instructions of the Data Fiduciary. MOAI™ may act as a Controller/Data Fiduciary
for certain datasets (such as user account information), and as a Processor/Data Processor when
handling information strictly on behalf of enterprise clients.


**2.4 “Applicable Privacy Laws”**

“Applicable Privacy Laws” refers strictly to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA), and their respective rules, notifications,
and guidelines. These laws govern how we collect, store, use, share, and protect Personal
Information, and they also provide individuals with enforceable rights regarding their data.

**2.5 “AI-Related Inputs”**

“AI-Related Inputs” means any prompts, queries, text, images, files, instructions, metadata, or
other content you submit to MOAI™’s AI-powered systems. This includes training data you
upload, documents you process, or text you enter while interacting with the MOAI™ platform.
These inputs may be processed for generating responses, improving service performance,
enhancing system security, and complying with legal obligations. MOAI™ does **not** use your
inputs to train its AI models unless the law explicitly allows it or you provide lawful consent.

**2.6 “Sensitive Personal Data / Special Categories of Data”**

Under GDPR, “special categories of personal data” include information relating to health,
biometrics, genetics, sexual orientation, political beliefs, trade-union membership, and religious
or philosophical beliefs. Under DPDPA, “Sensitive Personal Data” is not separately defined;
however, the Government may notify certain data as sensitive in the future. For the purposes of
this Policy, MOAI™ treats health information, financial information, biometric identifiers,
children’s data, and any data that could result in serious harm as high-risk and refrains from
collecting and using such data.

**2.7 “Anonymised Data”**

“Anonymised Data” refers to data that has undergone irreversible processing such that an
individual cannot be identified using any means reasonably likely to be used. For both GDPR and
DPDPA. MOAI™ may use anonymized or aggregated datasets for analytics, system improvement,


or research, but only after removing all personal identifiers that can tie all anonymous data back
to a person.

**2.8 “Consent”**

“Consent” means a clear, specific, informed, and freely given agreement, without any ambiguity,
by the individual to the processing of their Personal Information. Under GDPR, consent must be
affirmative and unambiguous. Under DPDPA, consent must be explicit, specific to a purpose, and
revocable at any time. MOAI™ relies on consent where required by law—especially for optional
features, cookies, marketing communications, and certain types of AI processing.

## 3. Information We Collect

**3.1 Information You Provide to MOAI™**

When you interact with the MOAI™ platform, you may provide information such as your name,
email address, phone number (if you choose to provide it), age, gender, login credentials, and
company or organizational details. You may also provide content and files when using AI
features—such as text inputs, uploaded voice datasets, or instructions given to the system. This
data is collected to create your account, personalize your experience, provide customer support,
improve platform accuracy, and fulfil contractual or legal obligations. All information you provide
is processed in accordance with GDPR and the DPDPA.

**3.2 Information Automatically Collected**

When you use MOAI™, certain information is automatically generated and stored by our systems.
This includes device and browser details, IP address, system logs, diagnostic information, usage
analytics, session identifiers, timestamps, and cookies or tracking technologies that help recognize
your device and remember your preferences. This automated information enables us to secure the
platform, detect misuse or suspicious activity, enhance performance, and better understand how
users engage with MOAI™. Where required, consent is obtained for the use of cookies or similar
tools.


**3.3 AI-Related Inputs and Outputs Processed by MOAI™**

If you submit prompts, files, messages, or other inputs to MOAI™’s AI systems, these may be
processed to generate responses, perform tasks, or support the functionality you request. These
inputs may also be analysed for maintaining system integrity, preventing abuse, detecting security
threats, and resolving technical issues. In jurisdictions where legally permissible, certain
anonymised or aggregated forms of these inputs may be used to improve service performance.
However, MOAI™ **does not** train its models on user data without explicit user consent or where
otherwise mandated by law. Your data is handled with strict access controls, encryption, and
safeguards appropriate for the sensitivity of the information involved.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

MOAI™ processes your Personal Information only for lawful and legitimate purposes, in line with
the GDPR and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA). The primary purpose of
collecting your information is to operate, maintain, and continually improve our platform and AI
systems. When you interact with MOAI™ —whether by creating an account, submitting prompts,
uploading files including audio notes, or seeking support—we use the data you provide to deliver
our core services. This includes generating AI outputs, authenticating your login, ensuring that
your account remains secure, and allowing you to access and use your workspace within MOAI™.

We also use your information to personalize and enhance your experience. This may involve
tailoring content recommendations, improving usability based on analytics, remembering your
preferences, or optimising product performance. When you contact us for support, we rely on your
information to investigate issues, resolve technical problems, or respond to your questions.
Additionally, we use diagnostic information, logs, and certain automatically collected data to
detect misuse, fraudulent activity, security threats, and other harmful behaviors that could impact
users or the integrity of our systems.

In certain scenarios, MOAI™ processes your Personal Information to comply with legal
obligations, such as responding to valid governmental or regulatory requests, maintaining
transactional records, and applying mandatory security safeguards. When performing data


analytics or service enhancement activities, we ensure the use of privacy-preserving methods such
as aggregation, minimization, limited retention, and where possible, de-identification.

Where the law requires, MOAI™ relies on specific legal bases for processing:

- Under **GDPR** , these include consent (where voluntarily provided), legitimate interests (such as
platform security and improvements), contractual necessity (processing needed to provide the
service you signed up for), and legal compliance (responding to authorities or meeting regulatory
duties).
- Under **DPDPA** , we process data when you give consent for a specific purpose, or when the
processing falls under certain legitimate uses defined in the Act, such as preventing fraud,
complying with a court order, or carrying out functions necessary for the service.

We do **not** use your personal data to train AI models without your explicit consent or unless such
training is legally permitted under an applicable framework.

**4.1. Services MOAI™ Provides and Can Provide**

MOAI™ is an AI-driven productivity and intelligence platform designed to support individuals
and organizations in creating, analyzing, and optimizing digital content, workflows, and insights.
Our services include generative AI outputs, document processing, text and data analysis,
conversational support, and various tools that enhance operational efficiency. MOAI™ may also
integrate with third-party applications to extend functionality—such as enabling collaboration,
data imports, data exports, or improved automation. As we continue to expand, MOAI™ may
introduce additional AI-powered features, analytics dashboards, enterprise-grade security controls,
and personalized recommendations based on user interactions. All such services are designed with
privacy-by-design principles and global compliance standards in mind.

MOAI™ is not a chatbot, not a diagnostic tool, and not a performance evaluator.
It is a _thinking partner_ —designed to ask powerful questions, encourage reflection, and empower
employees to take meaningful action.

**4.2. Business or Commercial Purpose for Collecting Personal Information**


We collect and process Personal Information strictly for legitimate business and commercial
purposes aligned with GDPR and India’s DPDPA. This includes enabling user account creation
and authentication, delivering core platform features, maintaining system performance, and
providing tailored AI outputs. Personal Information also helps us understand usage patterns,
troubleshoot technical issues, secure the system against fraud or misuse, and improve the quality
and accuracy of our AI models where legally permissible. In limited cases, we may process
information to comply with legal obligations, enforce our policies, maintain records, or support
regulatory inquiries. We do not sell Personal Information, and any use of data is carefully assessed
to ensure it is necessary, proportionate, and consistent with the expectations of our users.

**4.3. Website and Marketing Communications**

When you visit MOAI™’s website or interact with our marketing communications, we collect
certain information to personalize your experience and maintain the security and effectiveness of
our digital platforms. This may include IP addresses, device identifiers, browser metadata, cookies,
usage logs, and web analytics information. We use these insights to improve site performance,
understand visitor behavior, detect anomalies or suspicious activity, and optimize content for
relevance. If you subscribe to our newsletters or marketing updates, we may use your contact
information to send product announcements, feature updates, or promotional content. You may
opt-out of marketing communications at any time, and we ensure that such communications are
sent only as permitted by GDPR and DPDPA. Tracking technologies used for analytics or
advertising purposes are deployed in compliance with consent requirements and privacy-by-
default standards.

**4.4. Lawful Basis of Processing Information**

MOAI™ processes Personal Information under the lawful bases recognized by GDPR and India’s
DPDPA. Depending on the context, we may rely on consent, such as when you voluntarily provide
information or agree to marketing communications. In many cases, processing is necessary for the
performance of a contract, which includes providing access to MOAI™’s services and fulfilling
functionalities requested by the user. We may also rely on legitimate interests, such as improving
our platform, ensuring security, preventing fraud, or conducting internal analytics, provided such
interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms. Certain processing activities may


be mandated by legal obligations, including record-keeping, responding to government or
regulatory requests, or applying data protection safeguards. Under the DPDPA, consent and
legitimate use grounds may apply depending on the purpose. All lawful bases are assessed
carefully to ensure transparency, fairness, and compliance with applicable privacy frameworks.

## 5. How We Share Your Information

MOAI™ does not sell or commercially trade your Personal Information. We share it only in
limited circumstances necessary for the functioning of our platform and always subject to strict
privacy safeguards, contractual protections, and compliance with GDPR and DPDPA.

**5.1 Sharing with Service Providers / Data Processors**

To deliver MOAI™’s services, we engage carefully selected third-party service providers who act
strictly as data processors or data processors under DPDPA. These may include hosting
infrastructure providers, cloud platforms, analytics engines, email delivery systems, and
cybersecurity tools. These partners are granted access to Personal Information only to the extent
required for them to perform their services for us. They are legally bound by data protection
agreements that impose confidentiality obligations, prohibit the use of your data for their own
purposes, and require compliance with GDPR and DPDPA standards.

**5.2 Legal and Regulatory Disclosures**

In rare circumstances, MOAI™ may be required to disclose Personal Information if mandated by
law. This includes compliance with lawful government demands, regulatory inquiries, court
orders, data protection authority requirements, or obligations under GDPR or the DPDPA. Any
such disclosure is handled carefully and only after ensuring that the request is valid, proportionate,
and legally enforceable. We do not disclose more information than necessary for the purpose
requested.

**5.3 Business or Corporate Transfers**


If MOAI™ undergoes a merger, acquisition, investment transaction, restructuring, or sale of
assets, your Personal Information may be transferred as part of that transaction. In such events,
any new entity that takes over MOAI™’s operations will continue to be bound by this Privacy
Policy (or an equivalent policy offering substantially similar or stronger protections). We will take
reasonable steps to ensure that your information remains protected throughout the transition.

**5.4 International Transfers**

As MOAI™ may operate and use infrastructure in multiple jurisdictions, your information may be
transferred to or accessed from countries outside your own. If such transfers occur, we ensure
adequate levels of protection consistent with GDPR and DPDPA requirements.

For users located in the **EU/EEA** , we rely on approved transfer mechanisms such as the European
Commission’s **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** , together with additional technical and
organisational safeguards. For transfers involving the **UK** , we apply the UK’s international data
transfer addendum or other approved mechanisms Singapore, and others, we follow their
respective legally recognized frameworks, but only insofar as they are needed to maintain
compliance with GDPR and DPDPA for our users.

We will never transfer your Personal Information to a jurisdiction without ensuring that an
adequate and lawful data protection mechanism is in place.

## 6. Your Rights

We are committed to upholding the data rights granted to you under the GDPR, UK GDPR, India’s
DPDPA, and the Singapore/Malaysia PDPA frameworks. Depending on your jurisdiction, you
may have the right to request access to the Personal Information we hold about you, including
details regarding how it has been collected, used, and shared. You may also request corrections if
any of your information is inaccurate or incomplete. In certain cases, you may request deletion of
your data, subject to legal retention obligations or technical feasibility.

6.1. You may also have the right to restrict the way we process your Personal Information, object
to specific processing activities—especially those based on legitimate interests—and withdraw


any consent you previously provided. Where applicable, you may exercise your right to data
portability, allowing you to receive your information in a structured, commonly used, and
machine-readable format or request that it be transferred to another service provider. If your
jurisdiction provides opt-out rights (such as restrictions on data sharing or sale), we will comply
with those requirements as mandated by law.

6.2. You may additionally have the right to lodge complaints with a supervisory authority, such as
the Data Protection Authority under DPDPA, an EU Data Protection Authority, the Personal Data
Protection Commission (Singapore/Malaysia). We encourage you to contact us first so we can
address your concerns directly. We will respond to all rights requests within the timelines required
by applicable law.

6.3. **Use of AI:** MOAI™ integrates artificial intelligence systems to enhance functionality,
improve user experience, and deliver faster and more accurate insights. While AI plays a
significant role in generating suggestions, analytics, and outputs based on your inputs, MOAI™
does **not** rely on fully automated decision-making that affects your legal rights or significantly
impacts you without meaningful human involvement. All important or sensitive decisions remain
subject to human review.

Any data you provide to our AI systems—including prompts, uploaded files, and textual inputs—
is processed in a secure, controlled environment. This information is used solely for the purpose
of generating outputs for your use, improving system quality (only where legally permitted),
detecting misuse, and ensuring operational security. We do **not** use your data to train our global
AI models unless you provide explicit consent or unless a specific jurisdiction allows this under
strict conditions.

We ensure fairness, non-discrimination, and transparency in the functioning of our AI systems.
We employ a combination of technical safeguards, such as bias testing, model-level monitoring,
and prompt-level controls, to minimize risks associated with inaccuracy or unintended outputs.
Human oversight is always available to manually review and address concerns relating to AI-
generated content.

## 8. Security Measures


We implement stringent administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to
protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, misuse, accidental loss, destruction,
or alteration. These measures include industry-standard encryption for data both “at rest” and “in
transit,” ensuring that your information remains secure during storage and transmission. Our
systems utilize multi-layered access controls, such as strong authentication mechanisms, role-
based permissions, and principle-of-least-privilege enforcement, ensuring that only authorized
personnel can access sensitive data.

We continuously monitor our networks and infrastructure using intrusion detection systems,
firewall protections, and automated risk alerts to promptly identify and mitigate potential threats.
Our data minimization practices ensure that we collect and store only what is necessary for the
functioning of MOAI™, and all data is retained only for the duration required for lawful purposes.
We maintain secure, redundant backups to protect against accidental loss and ensure business
continuity.

In addition, we conduct regular internal and external audits, penetration tests, and vulnerability
assessments to evaluate and strengthen our security posture. Employees with access to Personal
Information undergo mandatory privacy and security training, and all third-party processors are
required to follow comparable levels of protection through contractual and technical controls.
These measures collectively ensure a high level of protection for all information processed through
MOAI™.

## 9. Data Retention

We retain Personal Information only for as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes for
which it was collected, including the fulfilment of our contractual obligations, compliance with
applicable legal requirements, and the resolution of disputes. The duration of retention depends on
the nature of the data and the context in which it was provided. For instance, account-related
information is retained for as long as your MOAI™ account remains active, while operational logs,
diagnostic data, and security audit records may be preserved for longer periods where required for
fraud prevention, platform integrity, and regulatory compliance.


Where laws such as the GDPR or India’s DPDPA impose mandatory retention periods, we adhere
to those timelines. Conversely, when data is no longer needed for legal, operational, or security
purposes, we take deliberate steps to securely delete or irreversibly anonymize it. Anonymization
techniques follow industry best practices to ensure that the data can no longer be linked to any
identifiable individual. We also periodically review our retention practices to ensure they remain
aligned with evolving regulatory standards and data-minimization principles.

## 10. Children’s Data

MOAI™ is not designed for or directed toward children, and we do not knowingly collect Personal
Information from individuals below the minimum age permitted under applicable laws. Under
COPPA (United States) if applicable, this age is 13; under the GDPR, the digital consent age is
generally 16 (or lower if permitted by specific EU member states); and under laws such as,
Singapore/Malaysia PDPA, and India’s DPDPA, local age-of-consent thresholds apply.

If we become aware that personal data of a child below the lawful age has been collected
inadvertently or without verifiable parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete such
information from our systems. We may also take appropriate measures such as disabling associated
accounts or requesting additional age verification if we suspect misuse. Parents or legal guardians
who believe their child has provided information to us without consent are encouraged to contact
us promptly so that we may take corrective action.

## 11. International Jurisdiction-Specific Addendums

### 11.1 GDPR / EU

For individuals in the European Union, MOAI™ may act as a **Controller** or **Processor** depending
on the specific data interaction and service we provide. We comply with all obligations under the
GDPR, including transparency requirements, lawful bases for processing, facilitating user rights,
and maintaining Data Processing Agreements where required. International data transfers from the
EU are carried out in accordance with the approved **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** and
any additional safeguards required by the European Commission or EU supervisory authorities.


**11.2 India – DPDPA 2023**

For users located in India, MOAI™ complies with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.
Where we act as a **Data Fiduciary** , we ensure that data is processed for lawful purposes with valid
consent or under legitimate uses defined by the Act. As a **Data Processor** , we act strictly under
the instructions of Data Fiduciaries, implement reasonable security safeguards, and assist in
fulfilling data principal rights. Consent is considered the primary basis for processing unless
exemptions provided under the Act apply.

## 12. Updates to This Policy

MOAI™ may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal
obligations, or technological advancements. Any updates will be published on this page along with
a revised “Effective Date.” Significant changes may also be communicated directly to users via
email or in-product notifications. We encourage you to review the policy periodically to stay
informed about how your data is handled.
