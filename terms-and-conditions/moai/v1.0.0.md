These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of MOAI™, an AI-driven coaching companion developed and operated by **Enablerz Digital Learning Pvt. Ltd.** (“Enablerz,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). By choosing to use or access MOAI™ , you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. About MOAI™
MOAI™ is a digital, AI-powered coaching companion designed to encourage reflection, self-awareness, and thoughtful decision-making. It helps users explore personal and professional situations by presenting reflective prompts, insightful questions, and coaching-oriented guidance based on the information the user provides. MOAI™ is built to act as a thinking partner rather than a source of prescriptive advice.

It is important to understand that MOAI™ is not a therapist, counsellor, psychologist, doctor, or medical professional, nor is it a source of legal, financial, consulting advisory, or clinical guidance. It does not provide diagnoses, professional assessments, emergency assistance, or any form of authoritative expert advice. Instead, MOAI™ aims to help individuals reflect, gain clarity, and navigate challenges through structured, coaching-aligned conversations.

MOAI™ is offered strictly as a B2B service, meaning it is made available to users through their employer or organisation. It is not a retail, direct-to-consumer product. When you access MOAI™ , you are doing so because your organisation has provided you with access as part of its employee-wellbeing, coaching, or developmental initiatives.
